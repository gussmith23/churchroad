# Add other Churchroad files. It's useful to put this as far down as possible.
# In general, only ADD files just before they're needed. This maximizes the
# ability to cache intermediate containers and minimizes rebuilding.
#
# In reality, we use the git functionality of ADD (enabled in our case via the
# optional flag --keep-git-dir) to add all of the checked-in files of the
# Churchroad repo (but not including the .git directory itself). We could cut
# this down further if we wanted, but I think this is a clean approach for now.
