# Example Lakeroad Programs

## bithack

The "bithack" examples come from the Chlorophyll paper:
[https://github.com/mangpo/chlorophyll/tree/241b68f4419c356e10828bbefead4f8407461ef9/examples/bithack].

Not all bithack examples are supported.
Specifically, examples which rely on "magic numbers" which don't fit in 8 bits
  are dropped (e.g. `count.cll`).
